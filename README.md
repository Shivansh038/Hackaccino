This program is the software for a garbage management system. 
Our product uses sensors to detect how much dustbins have been filled. When garbage crosses the threshold level, it sends a red signal and a beep to notify the people of this. The lid of the bin also closes.
The file: simulator.py gives hypothetical senson simulations
The file: location.py has a Location class that has bins in that loaction as objects and signal etc as methods. This class is used in simulator.py to perform further tasks
